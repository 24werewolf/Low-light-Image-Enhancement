# Low-light-Image-Enhancement
Python implementation of two low-light image enhancement techniques via illumination map estimation, based on the following papers:
 * Dual Illumination Estimation for Robust Exposure Correction [[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13688.pdf)]
 * LIME: Low-light Image Enhancement via Illumination Map Estimation [[link](http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~hbling/publication/LIME-tip.pdf)]
